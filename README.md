# command-line-life
## Implementation of Conway's Game of Life, in the terminal
Run `run_life.sh` to run the program. This script assumes that the width / height should be the full size of the terminal and that it should display 10 frames per second. Update the values of WIDTH, HEIGHT, or FRAMERATE if you would like to adjust how the program is displayed.
